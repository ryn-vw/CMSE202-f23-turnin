When you're done, you should have a plot that contains three different colors of dots and 4 different lines (3 of the lines should match the colors of the three penguin species, respectively)\n",

Then, create a `Pandas` `Series` called `labels` which takes the `species` column of the DataFrame, but replaces 'Chinstrap' and 'Gentoo' with 0 and replaces 'Adelie' with 1. Also, create a `Pandas` `DataFrame` called `features` which consists of just the four columns bill length, bill depth, flipper length, and body mass. Display the labels and features to make sure you did this correctly."
